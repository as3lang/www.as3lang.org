===============

build a community web site about AS3 with AS3  
for the people  
for the community  
for the language  


sure, it starts slow with a simple "hello world"  
but if you follow the evolution of the source code  
during the next few weeks  
you will learn and see  
all the things that AS3 can do server side  
and maybe get inspired to build your own web site using AS3 :)﻿  


Why AS3lang ?
